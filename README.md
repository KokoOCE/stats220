# Stats220 Repository

### *A little about me:*

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science, specialising **Data Science**
- I am taking STATS 220 because it is a requirement for my course
- I am interested in learning about how to interpret data and graphs


Here, have a meme about my mood right now at uni: 
![](https://c.tenor.com/4hYxMM5JuogAAAAC/tenor.gif)  

(I risk the nap and I ultimately sleep in too long and miss my 8am class)  

(on that note, WHO EVEN CHOOSES TO HAVE A CLASS AT THE BREAK OF DAWN)  


# My **goals** for this semester
1. Perfect grades (Unrealistic I know, but a boy can dream)
2. Perfect attendance to lectures (Im still dreaming)
3. Maintained enthusiasm (Probably the most unrealistic dream I have, but im actually quite excited for this course at the moment, that lab really put me in the mood to design pretty websites and memes)
